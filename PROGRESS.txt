To DO:
- The stencil buffer class is complete so now add a way to actually use that class in the engine class directly. (Not through the scene class)

----- TRY AGAIN -------
DOESN"T WORK RIGHT NOW

Still Doesn't work. Figured out the problem
For some reason (idk) the color picking thing works without the uniforms in the base shader being set but it picks unexpected data when the models
are drawn with the lighting uniforms being set.

To DO:

- The stencil buffer class is complete so now add a way to actually use that class in the engine class directly. (Not through the scene class)

----- TRY AGAIN -------
DOESN"T WORK RIGHT NOW

It works now but the problem is that It's all hardcoded for testing purposes. Need to actually use the StencilBuffer class in the Scene class to put a checkmark on this feature.

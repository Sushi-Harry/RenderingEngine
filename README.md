# RENDERING ENGINE

This is a rendering engine written using OpenGL and C++. The end goal of of this project is software ray tracing. After that, I will be moving on to using either Vulkan or DirectX 12 for hardware ray tracing.

## What's been added so far:
- Basic model loading using Assimp
- Basic lighting: Directional Lights, Point Lights, Spot Lights
- Skyboxes
- Very Basic GUI to control most of the things.
- Post Processing Effects (For now they only work one at a time.)

## What's Next:
- Shadow Maps
- PBR
- Software Ray Tracing

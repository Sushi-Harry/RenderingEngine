Like many of OpenGL's enums, their behind-the-scenes int value is linearly incremented,
so if we were to have an array or vector of texture locations we could loop over them by 
starting with GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_X and incrementing the enum by 1 each iteration, 
effectively looping through all the texture targets:
